####full-text-geocoder
The full-text-geocoder takes in a json file with data from a twitter stream, parses through it and extracts the user defined location. If the user defined location is a valid US location, the program outputs geographical information pertaining to the location. A sample load of what the program outputs can be found in the resources folder.
